# CommonsPub Client

## About the project
[CommonsPub](http://commonspub.org) is a project to create a generic federated server, based on the `ActivityPub` and `ActivityStreams` web standards). 

This is the front-end, written in Typescript that uses Apollo to fetch and update contents against a Graphql API.

This codebase was forked from [MoodleNet](http://moodle.net/).

## Forks and branches

### Flavours 
CommonsPub comes in different flavours, which are made up of a combination of extensions and probably some custom branding. Each flavour has its own branch in the [CommonsPub repo](https://gitlab.com/CommonsPub/Client) regularly merged back-and-forth with its own repository.

- `flavour/commonspub` - Contains the generic flavour of **CommonsPub**. 
- `flavour/moodlenet` - The original [MoodleNet](https://gitlab.com/moodlenet/frontend) flavour. 
- `flavour/zenpub` - WIP [ZenPub](https://github.com/dyne/zenpub/) flavour, which will use [ZenRoom](https://zenroom.org/) for public key signing and end-to-end encryption.
